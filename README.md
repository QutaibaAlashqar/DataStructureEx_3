we have given you a main.c and function.h files. The main.c file contains only the int main() 
function, while the function.h file will consist of the definitions of all the other functions you will use in this 
application. Complete the function.h file so that the main.cpp file works without error to generate the expected 
output. First, check the main.c file carefully. You can examine SimpleTutorial.pdf document to define 
functions in a separate file.
